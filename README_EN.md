## 💡 Why This Custom Edition?

As a PPTer who frequently needs to make presentations, have you encountered these pain points?

| 😫 Pain Point | ✅ Custom Edition Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **High API configuration barrier** - Original requires code changes, mainly supports overseas APIs | **Zero-code config + Chinese LLMs** - Frontend wizard-style configuration, supports Qwen, Baidu Wenxin, DeepSeek and other Chinese LLMs, no VPN needed |
| **Difficult to describe requirements** - Don't know how to write prompts for good PPT | **Structured form input** - Fill in topic, audience, style, auto-generate professional prompts |
| **Inefficient batch modifications** - 5 out of 10 pages unsatisfactory, need to regenerate one by one | **Batch select and retry** - Check unsatisfactory pages, one-click batch regeneration |
| **Inconsistent style** - Each page generated separately, overall style fragmented | **Unified style commands** - Apply same modifications in batch, maintain consistency |
| **Page limit** - Tools like NotebookLM limit to 15-20 pages | **Unlimited pages** - Generate as many pages as you want, no restrictions |
| **Opaque costs** - Don't know how many tokens used, hard to control expenses | **Real-time token monitoring** - Homepage shows token consumption stats, costs at a glance |
